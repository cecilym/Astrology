This project began as a way to organize herbs in terms of astrological energetics. On May 11th, 2020, I forked the project, modifying it to potentially organize and present delineations. On May 12th, 2020, I merged the projects so that users could switch between the Astro Herbalism and Herbal Energetics page views. It is now hosted on https://cecilym.github.io/Astrolog

There is currently only one delineation in the index.html file: Mercury in the domicile of Jupiter.

### Jekyll Themes
