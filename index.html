  <div class="delineation" data-category="mercury1 jupiterD sagittarius pisces 10 anyH">Mercury in signs ruled by Jupiter indicates messengers of Kings, especially in the 10th house. <em>Manetho</em></div>


  <!-- Saturn Conjunctions -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct anyD anyH flag">When Saturn and Jupiter are together, they bring about benefits from legacies and adoptions, cause men to be masters of property consisting of land, to be guardians, managers of others’ property, stewards, and tax gatherers. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>
  
  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 conjunct mars1 mars2 anyD anyH flag">Saturn and Mars are hostile, indicating reversals and ruin. They bring family quarrels, disharmony and hatred, along with treachery, plots, malevolence, and trials. However, if these stars are not in their own or in operative signs, and if they have benefics in aspect, they produce distinguished and noble nativities, although unsteady in their happiness and prone to unexpected dangers and treachery. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>
  
  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 conjunct mercury1 mercury2 anyD anyH flag">Saturn and Mercury are allies and indicate activities related to employment. They do, however, bring slanders about religion, lawsuits and debts, as well as disturbances about written matters and money. On the other hand, these stars make men who are not without resources and not unintelligent, with much experience and awareness, who are curious, far-seeing scholars, seekers after mystic lore, revering the gods, but with much on their consciences. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>
  
  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 conjunct venus1 venus2 anyD anyH flag">Saturn and Venus act harmoniously with respect to activities related to employment. They promote <em>temporary</em> success with respect to entanglements and marriage, agreeing and beneficial only for a time, not to the end. Indeed they cause abuse, divorces, inconstancy and death, often entangling men with the base-born and the lowly, causing them to fall into harm and lawsuits. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 conjunct moon1 moon2 anyD anyH flag">Saturn and the moon are beneficial, productive of money, estates, ship ownership, and profits from the deceased, especially if the moon happens to be in the part of its orbit just following first visibility and has benefics in aspect. Then it causes association with the great, gifts, and the discomfiture of enemies. This combination, however, is unsteady with respect to possession, and with respect to women it is insecure and painful because of separations, hatred, and grief. It also produces bodily suffering, sudden fits, pains of the governing faculties and nerves, as well as the deaths of important figures. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH flag">Saturn and the sun are at odds, giving and taking away possessions and friendships maliciously. Therefore those born under such a juncture suffer secret enmities and threats from great persons and are plotted against by some and live hated to the end. Playing their part well, they outlive most of their enemies. They are, however, not without resources, but are disturbed and long-suffering. They are selfcontrolled in this onslaught of reversals. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <!-- Jupiter Conjunctions -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH flag">When Jupiter and the sun are together, they produce noble and distinguished men, rulers, governors, dictators, vigorous men, honored and blessed by the crowd. These men are wealthy, rich, living with much spectacle. Sometimes however they are involved in uncertainties and hostility. Especially if Jupiter is found to be setting, they resort to greater showiness and make a pretense of the truth. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct moon1 moon2 anyD anyH flag">Jupiter and the moon are good, acquisitive: they cause men to be masters of adornments and slaves, and they bestow distinguished offices and ranks. They cause men to benefit from women and distinguished individuals, to be treated well by family and children, and to be thought worthy of gifts and honors. They make treasurers, men who lend much, who are trusted, and who find treasures and become wealthy. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct mars1 mars2 anyD anyH flag">Jupiter and Mars make glorious and showy characters, friends of the great or of kings, distinguished governors and receivers of stipends, those making a career in public affairs or in campaigns, and those considered worthy of honor and status, but uncertain in their livelihoods and habits, tossing away their possessions. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct venus1 venus2 anyD anyH flag">Jupiter and Venus are good, in harmony, productive of rank and profits, bringing new acquisitions, gifts, adornments, control over slaves, rulerships, the begetting of children, high priesthoods, preeminence among the masses, honors of garlands and gold crowns. These stars make men who are worthy of statues and images, but they also make them subject to ups and downs with respect to marriages and children. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct mercury1 mercury2 anyD anyH flag">Jupiter and Mercury are good, in harmony, and supervisory. They make men who are managers, overseers of affairs, in posts of trust and administration. They make men who are successful as secretaries and accountants and who are respected in education. These are approachable people with many friends, judged worthy of pay and stipends. If Jupiter and Mercury are found in operative signs, they make men discoverers of treasures, or moneylenders who profit from cash deposits. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>


  <!-- Venus Conjunctions -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="venus1 venus2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH flag">Venus and the sun are in harmony, glorious, bestowers of good. They cause the association of male and female, they bring gifts and conveyances, and make men successful in their enterprises. Occasionally they make those men who take on popular leadership or trusts, those who are in charge of foreign/secure places, those thought worthy of stipends. These men, however, are not without grief with respect to wife and children, especially if Venus is setting. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="venus1 venus2 conjunct moon1 moon2 anyD anyH flag">Venus and the moon are good with respect to rank, acquisitions, and the inception of business, but they are unsteady with respect to living together, friendships, and marriage, bringing rivalry and hostility, as well as ill-treatment and upset from relatives and friends. Likewise with respect to children and slaves, these stars are not good: they cause possessions to be fleeting and bring mental anguish. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="venus1 venus2 conjunct mars1 mars2 anyD anyH flag">Venus and Mars are at odds. They make men unsteady and weak of mind; they cause rivalry and murder; they cause men to have many friends, but to be blameworthy, shameless, fickle, and equally prone to intercourse with men or women; to be malicious, and plotters of murder by poison. These stars cause men to remain with neither the good nor the bad, to be slandered and reviled because of their friendships, to be spendthrift, flitting from one occupation to another, to be eager for many things, to be wronged by women and because of them to suffer crises, upsets, and debts.  <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="venus1 venus2 conjunct mercury1 mercury2 anyD anyH flag">Venus and Mercury are in harmony. They make men sociable and gracious, gregarious and hedonistic, paying attention to education and sensibility, receiving honors and gifts. For those of mediocre fortune, these stars bring about the receiving of goods, selling, and exchanges, and they bring a base livelihood. These stars make men unsteady and fickle with respect to women, changeable in their agreements with them. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>


  <!-- Mercury Conjunctions -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="mercury1 mercury2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH flag">Mercury and the sun make adaptable men with many friends, those flexible and self-controlled men who spend their careers in public places. These stars make pure, sensible men, men of good judgment, lovers of beauty, learned men, initiates into divine matters, beneficent, fond of their associates, independent, braggarts. These men endure reversals nobly, but are ineffective, suffering ups and downs in their livelihoods, experiencing vicissitudes. They are not poverty-stricken, but find a success proportional to the basis of their nativities. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="mercury1 mercury2 conjunct moon1 moon2 anyD anyH flag"> Mercury and the moon are good with respect to the union and status of men and women, with respect to the power of speech and education, and concerning commerce and other enterprises. They make men who act in common, who are resourceful, experienced, inquisitive. They also cause men to advance by great expenditures, to be very changeable, not persevering in their activities or intentions for the future. These men are noble in the face of adversity, but are subject to ups and downs in their livelihood. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="mercury1 mercury2 conjunct mars1 mars2 anyD anyH flag">Mercury and Mars are not good. They cause hostility, lawsuits, reversals, malice, betrayals, wrongs from superiors or inferiors. These stars make some men athletic, martial, commanding, beneficent, inquisitive of the occult, getting a livelihood in a varied manner. They resort to forgery in order to embezzle, steal, and loot, and having fallen into debt and expenses, they bring on themselves infamy and hot pursuit. If the configuration is afflicted, men meet with accusations and imprisonment, and they suffer loss or confiscation of goods. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>


  <!-- Sun Conjunctions -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="sun1 sun2 conjunct anyD anyH flag">The sun and the moon are good. They are productive of associations with the great and of high rank, as well as possession of estates, property, money, and adornment. These stars cause men to be successful in business enterprises and to receive profit. If the basis of the nativity is found to be great, men become leaders of cities, in charge of affairs, preeminent among the masses, gifted with a very high public image, munificent, governing, ruling, unsurpassed, and possessing a kingly property and spirit. Those starting with a moderate/average fortune become lucky and are called blessed. The good, however, does not last for this type of person, because of the waning configuration of the moon. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Jupiter, and the sun are unsteady and insecure. They bring failure with respect to possessions, friendships, and other business enterprises. They cause loss of possessions, and they cause some to fall into invidious accusations. These stars, having indicated help from unexpected sources or from legacies, and having increased someone’s reputation, bring ruin and accusation, along with sudden danger and plots. They do cause preeminence, guardianship of others’ business, tax gathering, and salaries, for the sake of which men endure disturbance and crises, but these stars make the basis of the nativity insecure and worrisome. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct moon1 moon2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Jupiter, and the moon are in harmony, bringing rank and profit, associations with the great, and gifts. Men travel abroad; they succeed in foreign lands or because of foreigners, not only in their own business, but also in others’. Men also derive benefits from women, and coming into possession of estates and land, they become lords. Some become shipowners and thus increase their livelihood, or they manage their livelihood by getting hold of whatever is involved with water. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct mars1 mars2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars bring about mixtures of good things. They make some men famous, highpriestly, governing, influential, in charge of the masses, of villages, or of military matters, commanding and obeyed. These men are not adorned with great show of wealth; they are involve in reversals, accusations, and violent affrays; and they lead worried lives. These stars cause others to be graced with the possession of an income, to be masters of estates and property, and to profit from the deceased, but their reputation is low. Therefore matters must be interpreted according to the configuration of the heavenly bodies and the effects of the signs.  <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct venus1 venus2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus are good, helpful in occupations, bringing possessions. They cause associations of male and female, as well as friendships, advancement, and benefits from legacies. However in their associations men are slandered and envied; they are unsteady in their marriages, suffering embarrassments, hostility, and judgements. On the other hand, they are fond of their associates and easy to live with, enjoying many new friendships. They are not entirely tranquil, nor do they lack grief with respect to children and slaves. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 jupiter1 jupiter2 conjunct mercury1 mercury2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury when configured together produce vigorous men, stewards, trustworthy, preeminent among the masses, commanding and obeyed, handlers of money and directors of documents and accounts. Such men have an independent and adaptable nature: sometimes they appear malevolent and wicked, and they will become covetous of others’ property, thievish, and greedy, because of which they will endure upsets and crises, debts and public infamy. Sometimes these men advance because of their success in action and because of their trustworthiness. Then they gain support and are thought worthy of gifts from the great and of honors. Since they have a generous disposition, they will benefit their own family and even others’. They, however, will take part in the mysteries and in esoteric affairs, and in other respects they will inquire into the curious arts and be subtle, pretending that their character is straightforward. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 mars1 mars2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Mars, and the sun are indicative of forcible, outré, and dangerous matters. These stars make bold men, men of great ambition, wicked atheists, traitors, insubordinate, men who hate their own families, who abandon their own relatives to go with strangers. They are involved in contumely and dangers. They suffer falls from high places or from animals. They are afraid of burns, and are toilsome in their activities. They do not guard what they already have, but desire others’ goods. They profit from crime. If, however, the configuration happens to be military or athletic, they are toilsome, but not unsuccessful. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 mars1 mars2 conjunct moon1 moon2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Mars, and the moon cause men to be venturesome in their business enterprises and noble, but ineffective, meeting with reversals and violence. They become in turn violent, reclusive, wicked: they have a plundering and thievish disposition,and become defendants in trials. They experience detention and criminal charges, unless of course the nativity happens to be fond of wrestling or of weapons, in which case the “detention” configuration is fulfilled by the holds of wrestling. Some become injured or diseased and will suffer a violent end. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 mars1 mars2 conjunct venus1 venus2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Mars, and Venus are favorable at the start of actions, friendships, associations. These stars bring profit, high rank, and political associations. Later, however, men are put into a disturbed state, liable to lawsuits arising from some envy/hatred and treachery. Because of this, such men make accusations and they endure hostility from men and women. They are involved in shameful faults and adultery, and are the object of scandal and denunciation. Some are inclined to unnatural, bisexual vices, and they become accomplices or participants in crime or murder by poison. Then they suffer no ordinary anxiety. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 mars1 mars2 conjunct mercury1 mercury2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Mars, and Mercury cause crime, treachery, judgements, and alarms. Men go into debts and expenses for the sake of scriptures or mystic lore, and they suffer no ordinary tribulations and ruin. In other cases these stars make men keen and intelligent in business, leading a varied life, maligned by some because of violent and illegal activities. Occasionally they become involved in toilsome and dangerous business and fall into poverty. Then they blame their own Fortune, blaspheme the gods, and become oathbreakers and atheists. If the stars are not in their proper domicile, they bring criminal charges and imprisonment. If the stars do happen to be in their proper, operative places, these men will undertake struggles of behalf of others and will generally prevail, or they will profit from documents, from accounts, or from public office, and will increase their livelihood. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="saturn1 saturn2 venus1 venus2 conjunct sun1 sun2 anyD anyH 3p flag">Saturn, Venus, and the sun are indicative of lofty associations, honors, and deeds, and they are the cause of high rank, distinction, and preeminence among the masses.

  <div class="delineation" data-category="mars1 mars2 trine sun1 sun2 anyH anyD nocturnal flag">For night nativities, Mars trine with the sun, especially when in feminine signs and on the right, indicates great and famous men, masters of life and death—provided that the rest of the aspects in the nativity agree. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">[Jupiter trine with the sun] If it is at an angle, it applies to the father: it indicates that he is famous, but less so than under the previous configuration. It indicates nothing unusual for the nativity if no other factor improves the outlook. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">For day nativities, Mercury as a morning star trine with the moon makes men inventive, successful, clever, and excitable. If the nativity is quite elevated, it makes secretaries of kings, rulers of cities or districts, scholars, orators, mathematicians. Mercury as an evening star, especially for night births, makes erudite men, philosophers and initiates of the mysteries. If the birth is lofty because of the other stars’ influences, it makes noble men, those honored by the masses and acquainted with the great and with kings. Mercury does this by being co-ruler with the star which supplies the primary influence. If it is in an inoperative place, it cannot apply any of its own influence. (In general it will be seen of all nativities that any star has the same effects in trine as it does when in conjunction in the same sign.) <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">[Jupiter trine with the sun] If Saturn is trine with the sun from the left and the sun is in the Ascendant, the rank will be higher: such men will own much land, have many estates, and become rich. If Mars is also in aspect along with Jupiter, the configuration indicates tyrants; especially if the sun is in the Ascendant, such men will control many districts and armies. If Saturn is also in aspect, the native’s father will be great, the leader of arms and armies (if indeed the rest of the aspects work towards his greatness), but he will not be a tyrant, warlike, or ferocious. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">If Mars is in opposition to the sun, with Jupiter and Saturn trine with the sun from the right, the native will lead the masses magnificently and with high rank. If Saturn is in opposition to the sun (under the stated conditions), the native will be opposed by family and friends, but he will prevail and subdue them. If Saturn and Mars are trine with the sun, with Jupiter in opposition in its own degrees or signs, the native is imperious and noble. If the configuration is sextile, the forecast is less spectacular. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="nocturnal venus1 venus2 trine moon1 moon2 taurus cancer virgo scorpio capricorn pisces anyD anyH flag">For night nativities, Venus trine with the moon and in feminine signs makes men charming and fortunate. Some rule the masses and are thought worthy of the purple and of golden ornaments— depending on the greatness of the nativity. They become philosophers, artists, scholars, and members of the circle of king’s friends. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">[Venus trine with the moon in feminine signs] If both Venus and the moon indicate the the birth is “royal,” because one is the houseruler and the other the master of the nativity, the configuration is dictatorial: men become king of kings, famous, merry. When sextile with each other, they have a more moderate power. When the stars are Good Daimon and Good Fortune, the effects are the same as if they were trine, especially if a tropic or an equinoctial sign lies between; even more so, if the configuration beholds Pisces and Taurus. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">[Mars trine sun in a night chart] In addition, if Jupiter is trine to the right, it makes great dynasts, rulers of cities and leaders of the masses. If the nativity is female and Venus is in conjunction, the native will be a queen and will have power over many districts; she will become a benefactor and be unsurpassed. For male or female nativities, if the one star occupies its proper place and the other happens to be in its own triangle, there is no opposition: they become king of kings, provided the one star is houseruler and the other is cohouseruler and master of the nativity, and that they both rule the Lot of Fortune and the Ascendant. If they are in masculine signs, fortune will be less, in fact much worse. Sextile configurations have a weaker effect, both for good or for the opposite. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">For day nativities, if Mars should be square with the moon while on the left and in another’s degrees or signs, it will be the cause of many reversals and afflictions for the mother, as well as reduction inrank. Men will be subject to travel; some become soldiers, toilsome and violent. These things happen, provided that the nativity is not base-born in other respects and that the master of the star, or its helper, or a fellow sect-member are not in places which do not have the Ascendant in aspect. If this condition does obtain the Ascendant is not in aspect, men become captives and die by execution. If Mars is in opposition (the other configurations being the same), bad results are stronger and more difficult to avoid. Indeed if it should appear square to the right, men suddenly lose everything. (The difference between square and opposition is great!) If Mars is in Aries its sign and the moon in Cancer its sign, the results are quite different and are like those for trine. Likewise if Mars is in Scorpio its sign, in opposition to the moon in Taurus, not only will there be no reversals of fortune, but in fact the stars will produce success and high rank. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>


  <!-- Sextiles -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">Venus sextile to the sun in the morning sky indicates that the father and the native will be charming and distinguished. If Venus is configured in Good Daimon or in Good Fortune, the native will be thought worthy (by women) of the purple and of golden ornaments. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>

  <div class="delineation" data-category="edit flag">Mercury sextile with the moon has a duller and weaker influence than do the previous configurations. Mercury square makes men keen and shrewd, but this keenness turns to criminality and the men become malicious, slanderers, acting with trickery and violence, inspired by nothing healthy. In addition to the previous malign influence, if the two are in opposition, the native is contrary-minded and ungracious in his activities, and so is harmed by what befalls him. <em>Valens on Planetary Combinations, Riley's translation</em></div>


  <!-- Oppositions -->
  <div class="delineation" data-category="jupiter1 jupiter2 opposite sun1 sun2 anyD anyH flag">Jupiter in opposition to the sun in most unpleasant: not only is all of Jupiter’s good influence quenched, but the native will feel the anger of superiors and the hostility of the masses.
